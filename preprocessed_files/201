ive playing 9 years worried par midend guitar ive using guitar looks feels great finish well done got warm full sound really enjoyed times found reluctant stop playing really pleased smooth fretting was felt like took less effort move frets press several guitars ive played previously gripe fret position markers dots really dark hard spot see pictures thats deal breaker means since playing would normally look markers side neck pretty clear still aesthetically dark markers look nice overall quite impressed especially great price know guitar good encourages play often again makes hard stop put down
